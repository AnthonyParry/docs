# Introduction

Scaphold is a Backend-as-a-Service platform that can save you hundreds of dev hours by vastly simplifying the process of creating, deploying, and monitoring a production ready GraphQL API. Scaphold provides a persistent data store, data modeling tools, advanced access control management, and monitoring dashboards to improve your developer experience. All of this is really great, but we couldn't stop there. Perhaps the most powerful aspect of the Scaphold platform is its integration infrastructure. Our integrations allow you to extend the functionality of your core API with push notifications, payments, email, social authentication, and much more. We built Scaphold to power real workloads and that means allowing you to use the same tools you already love.

GraphQL was developed by Facebook to power many of their mobile and web applications. A great deal of care was taken to ensure that GraphQL works from any client platform which means you can use Scaphold to build an application on virtually any platform. This means you can target your Scaphold API from iOS, Android, Web, and IOT applications using any framework without ever having to download an SDK. GraphQL presents a better way to build applications. It's that simple. You focus on what makes your app awesome and let us worry about the rest!
